**Please follow the below instructions to run our code:**

1) Download our best performing model checkpoint from [here](https://github.com/iamsashank09/multimodal-visual-question-answering/blob/main/models/best_val.model) and place in: 

		models/

2) Run *[multimodel-clevr-public.py](https://github.com/iamsashank09/multimodal-visual-question-answering/blob/main/multimodel-clevr-public.py "multimodel-clevr-public.py")* which is in the project root folder. (Make sure all the requirements are installed).

	    python multimodel-clevr-public.py
